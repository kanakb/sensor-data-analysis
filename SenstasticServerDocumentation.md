# What is the Senstastic Server? #

The Senstastic server is a framework that can interfaces with any Senstastic client and can be deployed on Google App Engine.

The server-side code was developed by Kanak Biscuitwala. Max Vujovic developed the Senstastic client. Both components were created as part of a research project in Spring 2011 at UCLA with Dr. Giovanni Pau serving as an advisor.

For any inquiries regarding the server, please do not hesitate to contact its developer at kanak `[at]` stanford `[dot]` edu.

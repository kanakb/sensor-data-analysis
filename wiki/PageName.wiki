#summary This page describes how to use the Android client side of the Senstastic framework to fit your needs.

= Introduction =

Senstastic is a lightweight framework for passive participatory sensing on Android devices. It allows you to schedule code to run at a specified interval on users' devices. That code will most likely use the device's built-in sensors in some way to generate measurement data. Senstastic can easily augment your measurement data with a geographic location (a latitude, longitude pair). Senstastic will save the measurement data to device until a WiFi connection becomes available. The device will then push the measurement data to the Senstastic server.

= Getting Started =

Checkout the SenstasticDemo Android project for a working example of a participatory sensing application called "Noise Mapping" built on the Senstastic framework. The easiest way to use the Senstastic client side is to understand the "Noise Mapping" demo and transform it to fit your needs.
